\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\highlight1\f0\fs22\lang9 IPsec Driver (System: Green)\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by the IPsec filter driver such as the following:\par
\tab Startup and shutdown of the IPsec services.\par
\tab Network packets dropped due to integrity check failure.\par
\tab Network packets dropped due to replay check failure.\par
\tab Network packets dropped due to being in plaintext.\par
\tab Network packets received with incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This may indicate that either the network card is not working correctly or the driver needs to be updated.\par
\tab Inability to process IPsec filters.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated on an IPsec filter driver operation. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated on an IPSec filter driver operation.\par
--------\par
Other System Events\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit any of the following events:\par
\tab Startup and shutdown of the Windows Firewall service and driver.\par
\tab Security policy processing by the Windows Firewall Service.\par

---------\par
Security State Change\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by changes in the security state of the computer such as the following events:\par
\tab Startup and shutdown of the computer.\par
\tab Change of system time.\par
\tab Recovering the system from CrashOnAuditFail, which is logged after a system restarts when the security event log is full and the CrashOnAuditFail registry entry is configured.\par
-------\par
Security System Extension \par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events related to security system extensions or services such as the following:\par
\tab A security system extension, such as an authentication, notification, or security package is loaded and is registered with the Local Security Authority (LSA). It is used to authenticate logon attempts, submit logon requests, and any account or password changes. Examples of security system extensions are Kerberos and NTLM.\par
\tab A service is installed and registered with the Service Control Manager. The audit log contains information about the service name, binary, type, start type, and service account.\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an attempt is made to load a security system extension. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an attempt is made to load a security system extension.\par
---------\par
System Integrity\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events that violate the integrity of the security subsystem, such as the following:\par
\tab Events that could not be written to the event log because of a problem with the auditing system.\par
\tab A process that uses a local procedure call (LPC) port that is not valid in an attempt to impersonate a client by replying, reading, or writing to or from a client address space.\par
\tab The detection of a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) that compromises system integrity.\par
\tab The detection of a hash value of an executable file that is not valid as determined by Code Integrity.\par
\tab Cryptographic operations that compromise system integrity.\highlight2\par
\par
Audit Policy Change (Policy Change: Yellow)\par
This policy setting allows you to audit changes in the security audit policy settings such as the following:\par
\tab Settings permissions and audit settings on the Audit Policy object.\par
\tab Changes to the system audit policy.\par
\tab Registration of security event sources.\par
\tab De-registration of security event sources.\par
\tab Changes to the per-user audit settings.\par
\tab Changes to the value of CrashOnAuditFail.\par
\tab Changes to the system access control list on a file system or registry object.\par
\tab Changes to the Special Groups list.\par
\par
Note: System access control list (SACL) change auditing is done when a SACL for an object changes and the policy change category is enabled. Discretionary access control list (DACL) and ownership changes are audited when object access auditing is enabled and the object's SACL is configured for auditing of DACL/Owner change.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when a remote RPC connection is attempted. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when a remote RPC connection is attempted.\par
-------\par
Authentication Policy Change\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by changes to the authentication policy such as the following:\par
\tab Creation of forest and domain trusts.\par
\tab Modification of forest and domain trusts.\par
\tab Removal of forest and domain trusts.\par
\tab Changes to Kerberos policy under Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Kerberos Policy.\par
\tab Granting of any of the following user rights to a user or group:\par
\tab\tab Access This Computer From the Network.\par
\tab\tab Allow Logon Locally.\par
\tab\tab Allow Logon Through Terminal Services.\par
\tab\tab Logon as a Batch Job.\par
\tab\tab Logon a Service.\par
\tab Namespace collision. For example, when a new trust has the same name as an existing namespace name.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an attempt to change the authentication policy is made. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when the authentication policy is changed.\par
\par
Note: The security audit event is logged when the group policy is applied. It does not occur at the time when the settings are modified.\par
---------\par
Authorization Policy Change\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by changes to the authorization policy such as the following:\par
\tab Assignment of user rights (privileges), such as SeCreateTokenPrivilege, that are not audited through the \ldblquote Authentication Policy Change\rdblquote  subcategory.\par
\tab Removal of user rights (privileges), such as SeCreateTokenPrivilege, that are not audited through the \ldblquote Authentication Policy Change\rdblquote  subcategory.\par
\tab Changes in the Encrypted File System (EFS) policy.\par
\tab Changes to the Resource attributes of an object.\par
\tab Changes to the Central Access Policy (CAP) applied to an object.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an attempt to change the authorization policy is made. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par

---------\par
Filtering Platform Policy Change\par
\par

\tab IPsec services status.\par
\tab Changes to IPsec policy settings.\par
\tab Changes to Windows Firewall policy settings.\par
\tab Changes to WFP providers and engine.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when a change to the WFP is attempted. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when a change occurs to the WFP.\par
--------\par
MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by changes in policy rules used by the Microsoft Protection Service (MPSSVC). This service is used by Windows Firewall. Events include the following:\par
\tab Reporting of active policies when Windows Firewall service starts.\par
\tab Changes to Windows Firewall rules.\par
\tab Changes to Windows Firewall exception list.\par
\tab Changes to Windows Firewall settings.\par
\tab Rules ignored or not applied by Windows Firewall Service.\par
\tab Changes to Windows Firewall Group Policy settings.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated by attempts to change policy rules used by the MPSSVC. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated by changes in policy rules used by the MPSSVC.\par
----------\par
