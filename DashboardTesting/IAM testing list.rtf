Detailed File Share\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit attempts to access files and folders on a shared folder. The Detailed File Share setting logs an event every time a file or folder is accessed, whereas the File Share setting only records one event for any connection established between a client and file share.  Detailed File Share audit events include detailed information about the permissions or other criteria used to grant or deny access.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an attempt is made to access a file or folder on a share. The administrator can specify whether to audit only successes, only failures, or both successes and failures.\par
\par
Note: There are no system access control lists (SACLs) for shared folders. If this policy setting is enabled, access to all shared files and folders on the system is audited.\par
\par
-------\par
File Share\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit attempts to access a shared folder.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an attempt is made to access a shared folder. If this policy setting is defined, the administrator can specify whether to audit only successes, only failures, or both successes and failures.\par
\par
Note: There are no system access control lists (SACLs) for shared folders. If this policy setting is enabled, access to all shared folders on the system is audited\par
-------\par
File System\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects. A security audit event is generated only for objects that have system access control lists (SACL) specified, and only if the type of access requested, such as Write, Read, or Modify and the account making the request match the settings in the SACL. For more information about enabling object access auditing, see {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=122083 }}{\fldrslt{https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=122083\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated each time an account accesses a file system object with a matching SACL. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a file system object with a matching SACL.\par
\par
Note: You can set a SACL on a file system object using the Security tab in that object's Properties dialog box\par
--------\par
Handle Manipulation\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events generated when a handle to an object is opened or closed. Only objects with a matching system access control list (SACL) generate security audit events.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when a handle is manipulated. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when a handle is manipulated.\par
\par
Note: Events in this subcategory generate events only for object types where the corresponding Object Access subcategory is enabled. For example, if File system object access is enabled, handle manipulation security audit events are generated. If Registry object access is not enabled, handle manipulation security audit events will not be generated.\par
-------\par
Kernel Object\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit attempts to access the kernel, which include mutexes and semaphores. \par
Only kernel objects with a matching system access control list (SACL) generate security audit events.\par
\par
Note: The Audit: Audit the access of global system objects policy setting controls the default SACL of kernel objects.\par
------\par
Other Object Access Events\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by the management of task scheduler jobs or COM+ objects. \par
For scheduler jobs, the following are audited:\par
\tab Job created.\par
\tab Job deleted.\par
\tab Job enabled.\par
\tab Job disabled.\par
\tab Job updated.\par
For COM+ objects, the following are audited:\par
\tab Catalog object added.\par
\tab Catalog object updated.\par
\tab Catalog object deleted.\par
-------\par
Registry\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit attempts to access registry objects. A security audit event is generated only for objects that have system access control lists (SACLs) specified, and only if the type of access requested, such as Read, Write, or Modify, and the account making the request match the settings in the SACL.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated each time an account accesses a registry object with a matching SACL. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a registry object with a matching SACL.\par
\par
Note: You can set a SACL on a registry object using the Permissions dialog box.\par
--------\par
Removable storage\par
\par
This policy setting allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects on a removable storage device. A security audit event is generated only for all objects for all types of access requested.\par
\par
If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated each time an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\par
\par
If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage.\par
--------\par
SAM\par
\par
